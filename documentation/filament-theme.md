# Filament Admin Panel Custom Theme

This project uses a custom Filament admin panel theme with Vite for asset bundling.

## How it works

- The custom theme CSS is located at `resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`.
- The Vite config (`vite.config.js`) includes this file as an entry point:
  ```js
  laravel({
    input: [
      'resources/css/app.css',
      'resources/js/app.js',
      'resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css',
    ],
    refresh: true,
  })
  ```
- After running `npm run build`, Vite outputs the compiled CSS to `public/build/assets/` and updates `public/build/manifest.json`.
- The Laravel app references the built CSS using the Vite helper, which looks up the file in the manifest.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error like:

```
Unable to locate file in Vite manifest: resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css
```

- Ensure the file exists at the correct path.
- Make sure it is listed in the Vite config input array.
- Run `npm run build` again.
- If the error persists, clear your browser cache and restart the server.

## File Structure

- `resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`: Your custom Filament theme CSS.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration with entry points.
- `public/build/manifest.json`: Generated by Vite, maps source files to built assets.

## Useful Commands

- `npm run build` — Build assets for production.
- `npm run dev` — Start Vite in development mode.
